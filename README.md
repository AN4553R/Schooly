this is a mathimatical excersises application for school students
that shows laws and needed info about geometrical shapes then can generate excersises to test absorption

# Bonus:
there is an extra choice in the main menu, the  choice named "Use File".
If the user chooses this option, then program reads five entries from a text file named "input.txt".
One entry for each shape (Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, Cube, and Cylinder).
Then the program calculates the areas of the five shapes
and sort them in an ascending order and write these values to a file named "output.txt".
